# 👋 Hi, I'm Mariya Spasova

I'm a Manual QA Specialist in training with a strong passion for software quality, accuracy, and user experience.  
I’ve completed the Manual QA module at SoftUni, and I’m currently studying Automation QA as part of my journey toward becoming a full-stack QA professional.  

Even though I’m at the start of my QA career, I’ve already built two manual testing projects that demonstrate my ability to design and execute tests, report bugs, and collaborate effectively.

---

### 🧩 What I Do
- Analyze requirements and design manual test cases based on user stories  
- Create and maintain test documentation (test suites, checklists, bug reports)  
- Execute functional, regression, smoke, and exploratory testing  
- Track and report defects using Jira
- Use TestRail for test case management and reporting  
- Perform API testing with Postman  
- Work with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- Apply Docker for test environment setup (learning stage)  
- Collaborate in Agile/Scrum environments and ensure effective communication  

I’m detail-oriented, proactive, and motivated to ensure the best possible software quality through teamwork and precision.
