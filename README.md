# 👋 Hi, I'm Mariya Spasova

I'm a Manual QA Specialist in training with a strong passion for software quality, accuracy, and user experience.  
I’ve completed the Manual QA module at SoftUni, and I’m currently studying Automation QA as part of my journey toward becoming a full-stack QA professional.  

Even though I’m at the start of my QA career, I’ve already built two manual testing projects that demonstrate my ability to design and execute tests, report bugs, and collaborate effectively.



### 🧠 Currently Learning
- Automation QA (SoftUni)  



### 🌱 About Me
Before joining QA, I held roles that refined my attention to detail, organizational skills, and communication abilities — qualities that enable me to succeed in testing and teamwork. I take pride in creating structured, high-quality QA documentation and continuously learning new testing tools and techniques.



### 🧪 My QA Projects

#### 📁 [Story Spoiler QA Project](https://github.com/MariyaSpasova-Git/story-spoiler-qa-project)
Manual testing of a demo web application for managing story spoilers.
Includes an SRS-based test design, bug reports, and Jira queries — with clear, structured documentation in Markdown format.

#### 📁 [Foody QA Manual Project](https://github.com/MariyaSpasova-Git/foody-qa-manual-project)
Manual and API testing for a demo web application for managing food-related content.
Focuses on functionality, input validation, and UI consistency — featuring test cases, test reports, defect logs, and queries.



### 🧩 What I Do
- Analyze and translate requirements (User Stories, Use Cases, and functional specifications) into comprehensive, traceable manual test cases.
- Develop and maintain critical test documentation (test suites and bug reports).
- Execute functional, UI, regression, and exploratory testing across applications.
- Manage the defect lifecycle and reporting using Jira.
- Leverage TestRail for comprehensive test case management.
- Perform API testing with Postman.
- Implement Git and GitHub for version control.
- Apply Docker for test environment setup (learning stage).
- Collaborate in Agile/Scrum environments and ensure effective communication.

I’m detail-oriented, proactive, and motivated to ensure the best possible software quality through teamwork and precision.
